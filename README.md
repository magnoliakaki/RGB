## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

After trying countless budgeting apps and software, I couldn’t find one that truly fit my needs—so I'm building my own. This app is a personal project that combines learning Kotlin with solving a real problem in my daily life. 

Color charge is a property of quarks. Quarks come in three colours: red, green, and blue, All free particles made of quarks must be colourless i.e. the colours "adds up" to zero.
This property mirrors the zero-based budgeting method: all money is assigned a purpose, so all money “adds up” to zero.
